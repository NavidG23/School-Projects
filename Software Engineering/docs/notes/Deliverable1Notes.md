## Deliverable 1 Notes
### Taken from in-class discussion 01/18/2017

 - *Hint*: Each "rule" for the game should probably be a user story.
 - Framework: Collection of tools, methods, classes, etc.
  - In Java there are several graphical frameworks, including Swing. Different ways to do graphical programming. 
 - Walking Skeleton
  - Have something that "works", but doesn't have any functionality implemented yet.
  - Display a window with a grid just to show that we all have Java, Git installed, access to Swing etc.
 - Interact with the game via clicking
  - Click the piece you want to move, then click the destination
  - Arrow keys, dragging, command line choices, etc. could be done later if desired.
 - The screen can be one static, fixed size. Do not need to make it resizable or dynamic.
 - Not specified what it should look like. Can be checkered, green, whatever. He will see if he likes it once it's done (like a customer would).
 - Future functionality (not for this Sprint)
  - One player should be able to resign/concede
  - Undo function -- **low priority**
  - Have the game keep track of wins/losses -- **low priority**
  - Have a "help" screen that displays instructions -- **medium priority**
  - Load game
    - Make sure that it can be saved/loaded without crashing -- **high priority**
    - Make sure that it's a valid state -- **medium priority**
