I did not discuss this project with anyone in the class. I consulted the wikipedia page provided in the code given since I
wasn't familiar with how to play.

Anything not working: N/A, but for some reason the program would not accept "amazons.config" as a file input so I changed
the file name to "amazons.txt" and it worked. I'm not sure why because I didn't change any of the original code. I included
the amazons.txt file incase and it is updated for the auto player.
